abstract = {The NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) is intended to operationalize the five-factor model of personality, both at the level of broad factors or domains and at the level of more specific traits or facets of each domain. However, only facets of three of the domains are currently measured. In this paper we describe minor modifications to the facet scales of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness, and the development of new scales to measure facets of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Conceptual distinctions within these domains were suggested by a review of the literature, and pilot studies provided preliminary evidence for the validity of new facet scales. Item analyses in a large and diverse sample (n = 1539) of adult men and women were used to finalize item selection and to confirm the structure of the Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PIR) at both the item and the scale level. Correlations of the NEO-PIR with a variety of other self-report scales in a second sample of 394 men and women provided evidence on the convergent and discriminant validity of scales to measure Trust, Straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty and Tender-Mindedness as facets of Agreeableness, and Competence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline, and Deliberation as facets of Conscientiousness.}

abstract = {College students (308 undergraduates) completed the Five Factor Inventory and the Academic Motivations Scale, and reported their college grade point average (GPA). A correlation analysis revealed an interesting pattern of significant relationships. Further, regression analyses indicated that conscientiousness and openness explained 17% of the variance in intrinsic motivation; conscientiousness and extraversion explained 13% of the variance in extrinsic motivation; and conscientiousness and agreeableness explained 11% of the variance in amotivation. Further, four personality traits (conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism, and agreeableness) explained 14% of the variance in GPA; and intrinsic motivation to accomplish things explained 5% of the variance in GPA. Finally, conscientiousness emerged as a partial mediator of the relationship between intrinsic motivation to accomplish and GPA. These results are interpreted within the context of what educators could do to encourage and nurture student motivation and achievement.}

abstract = {We collected multiple measures from 100 students at a small public undergraduate liberal arts college in the Midwestern US and later assessed their academic success. The “proactive” (hard-working, persistent) aspect of the Big Five trait of Conscientiousness and not its “inhibitive” (organized, careful) aspect is a large positive predictor for two graduation outcomes and grade point average (GPA). The Big Five trait of Agreeableness (“pro-sociality”) is a large and negative predictor for graduation outcomes. A non-standard cognitive skill measure (a backward-induction game) positively predicts graduation outcomes, in parallel with its success in predicting vocational student job success (Burks et al., 2009). Patient time preferences predict one graduation outcome and GPA.}

abstract = {We evaluated two models of the factor structure underlying the variables of Jackson's (Personality Research Form Manual, 1984) Personality Research Form (PRF). One model posits the well-known Big Five factors of personality. The second model, in contrast, splits the Conscientiousness factor of the Big Five into an Achievement factor, having to do with ambition and hard work, and a Methodicalness factor, having to do with the need for organization and orderliness. Substantial support for the latter of these two models is presented in three studies, both from results of confirmatory maximum likelihood factor analyses and from the differential predictability of the factors with regard to various criteria. It is concluded that at least six factors are needed to account for behavior consistencies at the highest level of the personality hierarchy.}
